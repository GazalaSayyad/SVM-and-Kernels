# SVM-and-Kernels
  In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis.
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane. In other words, given labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples.
             Support Vector Machine
1. SVM assumes that the data is lineraly separable.
2. It chooses the line which is more distant from both the classes.
In SVM algorithm we find the points closest to the line from both the classes.These points are called support vectors. We compute the distance between the line and the support vectors which is called as the margin. Our goal is to maximize the margin. The hyperplane for which the margin is maximum is called optimal hyperplane.




             Kernel
The kernel means transforming data into another dimension that has a clear dividing margin between classes of data.
